##Weekly challenge 02
:small_orange_diamond: For this week, we had to recreate another online newspaper just like the week before, but in this case we didn't have to create only the HTML, we also had to include CSS and develop a "pixel-perfect" copy of the website. Then, we used the same stylesheet from the second HTML page, in the first one.
